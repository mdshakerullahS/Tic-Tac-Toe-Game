# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
<br>
This is a simple and interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to play against each other on the same device. It includes a clean user interface with a 3x3 grid, turn-based gameplay, and win/draw detection logic. When a player wins or the game ends in a draw, a message is displayed with an option to restart the game and play again.
